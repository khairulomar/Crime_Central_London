### Executive summary:

In this study, we looked at 3-year UK Police database on street crime and stop & search conducted by the police in a 1 mile radius around Moorgate, London between Dec 2016 and Nov 2019. Upon analysing the dataset and considering other claims that were made in the media, we proceeded to come up with our own hypothesis tests to investigate the following questions:
1. From the data, there appears to be higher level of crime in the later half of the year compared to the first half. Are the differences in crime level by month statistically significant and what may be the drivers behind them?
<br><br>
2. Conviction rate for a crime is a matter of public concern as can shape the public perception on the effectiveness of the police force. Our data seem to suggest that suspect for violent crimes around Moorgate is less likely to be identified than others, but is this true?
<br><br>
3. There has been independent reports that ethnic minorities are generally more likely to be stopped and searched compared to the general population. Would our data around Moorgate come up with the same conclusion?
